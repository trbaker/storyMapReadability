# ArcGIS Storymap readability
Determines the Fleschâ€“Kincaid grade level and Lexile readability of an ArcGIS Storymap.

## Sample Python
main.py - sample  Python code with three preset storymap ids.  


Note: the above scores are *close* to the readability scores one might obtain from MS Word but are not exact.  Thi is due in large
part to fast code production.  We also don't know the exact formula used by MS.
